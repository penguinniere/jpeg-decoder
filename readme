--how to compile--
	g++ ./decoder.cpp -fpermissive =o ./decoder
	or
	make

--how to execution--
	./decoder jpeg_file_path bmp_file_path [-y coef] [-cb coef] [-cr coef]
	the jpeg_file_path and bmp_file_path must appear as 2en and 3rd 
        parameter specificly.
	When setting -y -cb -cr, the program will scale the coefficient when 
        convert ycbcr into bgr format.
	The coefficient is limit by -5.0~5.0.
